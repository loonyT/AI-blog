          <p>IT users, agents, and customers need the most effective service. Moreover, its benefits can aggregate since
            it intervenes at each step of the process. From the very first call to the administration of the system.
          </p>

          <p>Here are four ways AI can benefit your help desk:</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">1. Filter the requests for the first-line resolution: </h2>

          <p>Whatever the channel an agent chooses: phone, mail, chat,… He has to state his problem in his own words.
            Thanks to machine learning, the AI will build its knowledge base. How? After an analysis of what the
            end-user communicates and the context of the request. The Chatbot will establish a set of predefined
            answers. </p>

          <p>Afterward, if a predefined certainty threshold is reached. A solution is found and suggested to the user.
            If the certainty rate is not high enough. The Chatbot transfers the request to the most qualified human
            agent.</p>

          <p>So, thanks to that two-step filter, the end-user will always have an answer. Also, qualified agents will be
            able to focus on more complex requests.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">2. towards a superhuman agent? </h2>

          <p>Once the filter mentioned above is passed, the human agent receives the file. The added value is the agent
            dealing with a preprocessed request. Additionally, the virtual assistant gives solutions, with an order of
            priority, for the incidents it has recorded. </p>

          <p>That combination of AI and human intelligence accelerates resolution time. It also speeds up the training
            process of the agents. Thanks to AI, those can answer more complex requests in a few weeks of training only.
            Consequently, the overall profitability raises. As well as the customer degree of satisfaction. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">3. Raising customer satisfaction thanks to emotional analysis. </h2>

          <p>If you assess <i>customer satisfaction. </i>Either through an annual report or live. You will have an
            overrepresentation of dissatisfied customers. Yet, you can have a more objective result if you use AI to
            process customer’s answers. The technology can analyze the words, the tune, the sentences, and the frequency
            of talks. For the agent or the customer. </p>

          <p>Therefore, your AI assistant can build an objective and transparent report about the customer’s experience.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">4. Using data to improve and operate your ITSM. </h2>

          <p>Support database of accidents is a gold mine of data regarding daily operations. AI can help you make the
            best use of that information. Whether to improve your system or to diagnose more structural issues. You can
            then compare the profile of the users, the type of request, and the nature and context of the accidents.
            Thanks to that process, you can identify: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Inappropriate use, underexploited resources, sleeping licenses, or outdated software. </li>
            <li>Sharing all that information with the other departments of the company can: </li>
            <li>Raises your business productivity and leads to further optimizations. </li>
          </ul>


          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

          <p>In the end, the advantage of AI is that it records everything. Every interaction or conversation is stored
            and analyzed. Thus, all the benefits discussed above are enhanced by this process. On the other hand, the
            information that an AI processes, in this context, is private property. That’s why you need to conform with
            the GDPR when you process data belonging to people. </p>
