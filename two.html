        <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
          <p>To ensure business continuity and the quality of the services, large corporations can use a Service Desk.
            There, all IT requests and issues from all companies’ departments will be centralized. </p>

          <p>Therefore, it is relevant to measure the performance of your Service Desk. You can do so by analyzing the
            reporting activity. If you have the proper software. </p>

          <p>However, there are so many metrics to review that it can be hard to know which ones to focus on. In this
            article, you will see the ones which are relevant in terms of: </p>

          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>productivity</li>
            <li>business continuity</li>
            <li>costs control</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <ol>

            <li><strong>Ticket trend</strong></li>
            <p>The number of tickets that arrive at the Service desk in a given period. With a supervisor interface, you
              can have access to a detailed chart that shows the ticket trend. Thanks to this report, you can optimize
              incidents and service requests by: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Spotting the busiest periods to optimize the distribution of resources.</li>
              <li>Creating the appropriate reserve of agents for the relevant periods.</li>
              <li>Identifying training requirements. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Average ticket resolution time</strong></li>
            <p>One of the most important metrics. You can get it with that formula:
              (Required time to solve all ticket) / (number of tickets) = Average ticket resolution time.
              With the proper reporting tool, you can thus:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Optimize your OLA’s and SLA’s. And, measure your team’s and agent’s productivity. </li>
              <li>Analyze the patterns in service requests to create the appropriate knowledge base. </li>
              <li>Automate the workflow to reduce the required time for manual ticket processing. </li>
              <li>Reduce wrong affectations of tickets </li>
              <li>Label and classify similar tickets. To reduce time loss when several agents are working to solve the
                same kind of problem. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Number of tickets solved at the first call </strong></li>
            <p>A ticket is considered solved at the first call when it is handled at the first level. With no more than
              two comments in the comments queue. When you know the numbers, you can assess the efficiency of your
              teams. After, you can optimize your workforce by assigning it to the right level of support. And, you can
              use the report to: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Identify the training needs of specific agents, to allow them to solve first-line issues</li>
              <li>Create a detailed form to collect relevant data which are required to solve user’s tickets at the
                first call. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Total stopping time</strong></li>
            <p>That metric refers to the period within which critical IT services are not available. You can measure
              that time with a dedicated feature. Next, you can automate the creation of tickets during that stopping
              time. Which will help you to ensure what you have guaranteed in your SLA. Thanks to this information, you
              can: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Optimize the updates and the migration of servers</li>
              <li>Make your teams aware of the indirect costs that can arise from IT failures </li>
              <li>Prepare and train your IT agents so that they can anticipate future failures. And raise the efficiency
                of the service desk. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>SLA conformity </strong></li>
            <p>A ticket request is considered failed when it is not resolved according to the conditions the parties
              agreed upon in the SLA. Some services can provide you with a relevant report. It will give you a precise
              view of which number of tickets are solved, according to the SLA. Thanks to it, you can measure the number
              of SLA violations and take the proper measures: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Match the company expectations with available IT skills to define realistic SLA. </li>
              <li>Raise your team’s awareness concerning the commercial impact of SLA violations </li>
              <li>Define the escalation matrix, in case of a breach in the SLA. </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Ticket’s cost </strong></li>
            <p>You can obtain it with this formula:
              (Operating cost of IT support) /(total number of tickets in a given time) = Cost per ticket. Thanks to
              that, you can keep track of a ticket’s cost, which is required for an optimized budget. You can also
              identify the training needs of your agents to keep the costs under control.
            </p>

          </ol>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>

          <p>Having proper metrics is thus required to assess and optimize the performance of your service desk. To do
            so, you need the proper tools and the relevant reports.</p>
