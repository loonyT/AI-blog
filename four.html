          <p>To raise your ITSM productivity with automation, you have to understand the underlying mechanisms. Automate
            a task requires input. It will then trigger the automation procedure to complete the duty. That procedure
            can have several steps and will lead to an output. Which is the completion of the task. </p>

          <p>That process is optimized for simple, repetitive, and time-consuming duties with low added value.</p>

          <p>For instance: When a ticket is open by a Service Desk agent, the user automatically receives notifications.
            Thanks to that information, he can have a precise idea about how his request is handled. This allows your
            agent to focus on what matters: resolving the ticket. </p>

          <p>By automating some of your ITSM processes, you can transform your business and improve its user experience.
            Moreover, if you follow a set of best practices, you can also: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Save time</li>
            <li>Improve your competitiveness</li>
            <li>Raise your profits </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Automation best practices</h2>

          <p>However, you have to pay attention when you implement automation. The goal is not to have more of it but to
            have it implemented qualitatively. For that, you have to stick to the best practices. Here is an abstract of
            core principles you can follow:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><strong>In-depth check of your workflow : </strong></li>
            <p>You must only consider the workflows with an added value opportunity for automation.</p>

            <li><strong>Skip on complicated self-executing processes </strong></li>
            <p>Do not fall into the trap of automating too much. It is tempting because there are lots of opportunities.
              However, the more complicated the process to automate is, the more difficult it will be for you to fix it,
              in case of a problem. </p>

            <li><strong>Outline and improve your existing processes </strong></li>
            <p>You have to know who is in charge of a dedicated process. After, ask yourself this: how does that agent
              work, and what are the implications? Once you have an overview of this for all your team, you can aim at
              two objectives: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Provide your workforce with a relevant reserve of skilled Agent, in case you would lose one (sick
                leave, holidays,)
              </li>
              <li>
                Guarantee a continuous improvement of your processes
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Often, incremental and targeted change is more efficient than a massive upgrade. </p>

            <li><strong>Don’t use too many technologies for the same process </strong></li>
            <p> For instance, if you integrate a large set of technologies (JSON, API, active directory, email,) to your
              process, you are also raising the complexity. The more simple and coherent the processes are, the more it
              will be easy to automate them. </p>

            <li><strong>Identify which actions will be triggered by a Chatbot </strong></li>
            <p>When it comes to automating ITSM processes, your users can benefit from the use of a Chatbot. If an agent
              makes a request, the virtual assistant can provide him with an answer. </p>
            <p>For instance, one of your agents needs a new screen for his desktop. He could call the Service Desk or
              talk to the Chatbot. The bot has all the information about the employee’s device and can thus make the
              relevant order. Consequently, even a late-night problem can be automatically solved. Without the need for
              human intervention. </p>
          </ol>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>Therefore, adding an automation layer within your workflow can make your business more efficient. Moreover,
            by following the best’s practices, you can enhance that efficiency. If you want more information about how
